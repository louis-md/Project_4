# **Data Vizualization**

Prepare, cleanup and visualize data about carnivorous predators 🐆🥩😋

Louis, Adèle

--- 
# Dataset:

A compilation of scientific studies gathering information about the diet of various carnivorous animals on the planet 🌍

Many information about the animals themselves, but also the scientific articles they are taken from.

👓 Let's take a look 👓

- 29k rows / 53 columns
- Mainly categorical data

---

# How things went:

- (Install VSCode)
- Get the right data file
- Figure out what the data is about
- Drop useless/unsignificant columns
- Drop rows with "typos"

---
- Drop rows where commonNameCarni & commonNamePrey are the same

💥 DROP 25K ROWS 💥

- heatmap was a nice idea, but...

---
# Animals
- Most predatory predator
- Distribution of predators by number of preys (std, variance, IQR)


# Scholars
- Most prolific author(s)
- Distribution of authors by number of articles (std, variance, IQR)
- Most data extracted from a single article

# What we learnt:

- Bad plots make great art 👨🏻‍🎨
- Hard to visualize data without having:
    - Clear understanding of it
    - Clear objectives of what we are looking for
- Spent a lot of time figuring out what we want to show
- Hard time getting away from line and box plots
- Hard time extracting actual valuable information from the data
